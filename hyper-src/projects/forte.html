    <h2 class="distinct"> Motivation </h2>
    In February of 2024, I competed at RowdyHacks during the 9th
    annual Hackathon. This was my second time attending, having 
    <a class="link" href="/projects/fractal-viewer"> 
      placed second the previous year 
    </a>. 
    My understanding of programming and of Rust had grown significantly over
    that time, and I wanted to one-up myself. I had just finished my Computer
    Organization class, where we learned to program in x86 assembly. The class
    made me realize that the design of an assembly language has a profound
    impact on every higher level language built on-top of it. As a Rust
    programmer who cares a great deal about safety and soundness guarantees, it
    troubles me that I have to compile to an inherently unsafe assembly
    language. I wanted to find out how feasible it would be to write a new
    assembly language designed for easy static analysis and safety guarantees.
    I am very satisfied with the result, which I named Forte.
    <h2 class="distinct"> Specifications </h2>
    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    Forte is an assembly language and bytecode for a hypothetical 128-bit
    processor. It contains 26 instructions, but no directly exposed registers.

    <h3> The Three Stacks </h3>
    The stack is an essential part of any assembly language, however it is
    often a point of vulnerability. Stack-smashing and stack-overflow
    vulnerabilities can very easily allow attackers to overwright function
    return addresses, and and execute arbitrary code. This is why Forte uses
    three distinct stacks.
    <h3> The Program Stack </h3>
    The program stack, or p-stack for short, contains all of the state for the
    user-space program. When you push or pop a value in Forte, you are
    interacting with the p-stack. What's most interesting about the p-stack is
    what it does not contain: pointers. There is no way to jump to an address
    on the p-stack, as its contents are considered untrusted. 
    <h3> The Control Stack </h3>
    In order to call functions, return addresses must be stored somewhere.
    While most assembly languages place these on the stack alongside other
    values, Forte segregates them into a separate control stack (c-stack for
    short.) This is similar to the "shadow stack" option some compilers use,
    except implemented at a hardware level. The only way to interact with the
    c-stack is through call and return instructions.
    <h3> The Function Stack </h3>
    Most assembly languages have a "jump" instruction which moves the program
    counter to an arbitrary point in memory. This is useful but not
    particularly safe. Forte only allows jumping to valid functions. The
    locations of these functions are kept in the function stack (f-stack.)
    Functions are added to the f-stack after they are validated during the 
    warmup phase, which I will discuss next.
    <h3> Warmup </h3>
    When a Forte program begins, it does not immediately start executing 
    instructions. Instead, it validates the programs correctness and builds
    the f-stack. Every <code>fun</code> (function start) instruction will
    push the address of that instruction to the f-stack. Every instruction that
    interacts with the stack will increment or decrement an internal register
    accordingly. If this value value falls below zero or above the maximum
    stack size, then the program is determined to be unsafe and execution
    is cancelled before it begins. The warmup phase will take O(N) time,
    where N is the number of instructions.
    <h3> Recital </h3>
    After the <code>exe</code> (begin execution) instruction is reached, the
    Recital phase begins. The function pointer returns to the address at the
    top of the f-stack, which was the last defined function. When the program
    counter reaches the <code>exe</code> again, the program has terminated
    successfully. This combination of design decisions means that the program
    counter can never be lower than the first function address, or larger than
    the execution instruction. This makes arbitrary code execution attacks more
    difficult to pull off. 
    <h2 class="distinct"> Safety </h2>
    Creating a memory safe assembly language presents much different challenges
    from a compiled language like Rust. There are no compile-time checks or 
    guarantees, any string of bytes could be interpreted as a "program." The core
    design principle of Forte is to make unsecure programs impossible (or at least
    very difficult) to express, and to make static analysis simple. This is a delicate
    balance to strike - limiting Forte's capabilities necessarily makes it more
    cumbersome and less performant.
