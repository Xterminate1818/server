    <h2> Front End - Parser Design </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 class="distinct"> Motivation </h2>
    HTML is a powerful tool for creating static web pages, but 
    is not easily modular or scalable. Front end frameworks like
    React provide reusable components. I want to use components
    without the overhead of a front-end framework. I want the final output to be statically generated rather than generated on the fly
    by the server or the client, minified and with inlined CSS and 
    JavaScript.
    <h2 class="distinct"> Approach </h2>
    After looking at some of the HTML parsing libraries, I was 
    unsatisfied with the approaches most developers took. The DOM
    is represented as a tree structure, where each node keeps a 
    pointer to its children.
<@code lang="rust">
// From the html_parser crate
pub enum Node {
    Text(String),
    Element(Element),
    Comment(String),
}

pub struct Element {
    pub name: String,
    pub attributes: HashMap<String, Option<String>>,
    pub children: Vec<Node>,
    // other fields omitted
}
</@code>
  This is bad for cache locality and effectively forces the use
  of recursion in order to traverse the DOM. Recursion is undesirable
  for performance and robustness reasons. My approach is to create a
  flat array of elements. Parsing is done using a non-recursive parser
  combinator model.
<@code lang="rust">
// My implementation (fields omitted)
pub enum HtmlElement {
  DocType,
  Comment(/* */),
  OpenTag { /* */ },
  CloseTag { /* */ },
  Text( /* */ ),
  Script { /* */ },
  Style { /* */ },
  Directive { /* */ },
}
</@code>
  This approach lends itself to linear iterative algorithms. An 
  element's children can be represented as a slice of the DOM array, 
  from the opening tag to its close tag.
  <h2 class="distinct"> Templates </h2> 
  I define a "template" as a user defined element which expands into
  a larger piece of HTML. Templates can pass on children and attributes
  to the final output. Some special templates can perform other functions,
  like inlining a CSS file or syntax highlighting a code block.
<@code lang="html">
<!-- Here is a template definition -->
<Echo> 
  <h1 class=@class1> 
    <@children/>
  </h1>
  <h2 class=@class2> 
    <@children/> 
  </h2>
  <h3 class=@class3>  
    <@children/> 
  </h3>
</Echo>

<!-- And this is how to use the template -->
<Echo class1="some_class1" class2="some_class2" class3="some_class3">
  Echo!
</Echo>

<!-- Which expands to this -->
<h1 class="some_class1"> 
  Echo!
</h1>
<h2 class="some_class2"> 
  Echo!
</h2>
<h3 class="some_class3">  
  Echo!
</h3>
</@code>
  The example above shows how templates can inherit attributes and child
  elements from their invocation. Special templates begin with the '@'
  symbol, and perform some sort of meta-function. In addition to
  &#60;@children/&#62;, &#60;@code/&#62; performs syntax highlighting, and
  &#60;@style/&#62; inlines a CSS file.

  <h2 class="distinct"> Dependencies </h2>
  The templating engine only relies on two crates for performing syntax 
  highlighting of code blocks. It uses inkjet, a thin wrapper over
  treesitter. Treesitter is an efficient error-tolerant language parser
  commonly used in IDEs. While it is fast, it is by far the slowest and
  most cumbersome part of the program. Good looking formatted code is 
  important for my website, and implementing parsers for every language
  I use is out of scope, so this is a necessary evil.
<@code lang="toml">
// Snippet from Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
inkjet = "0.10"
v_htmlescape = "0.15"
</@code>
