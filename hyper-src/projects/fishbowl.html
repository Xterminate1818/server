    <h2 class="distinct"> Motivation </h2>
    Physics solvers tend to be very complex software. In the
    past, I toyed around with physics solvers for different kinds of geometries, but
    struggled to implement these algorithms in a way that was both convincing
    and performant. The idea for Fishbowl came from a video by the creator
    Pezzza. They describe the high-level implementation details of a Verlet
    Integration solver. This approach caught my interest.
    <div class="video">

      </iframe>
    </div>
    Pezza's work is very impressive, particularly the demonstration at the end
    which proves the program is deterministic. However, the focus of Pezzza's
    project was to create a performant real-time application. I was instead
    interested in pre-rendered images and animations. I decided to expand the
    one-off demonstration at the end of Pezzza's video into a fully fledged
    app.
    <h2 class="distinct"> Approach </h2>
    At the center of any physics solver is the physics 'step', a fixed interval of
    time where objects move and collide. The physics step of Fishbowl consists of five
    distinct phases.
    <@code lang="rust">
// Keep all objects inside the simulation bounds
self.constrain_rect();
// Sort objects from left-most to right-most.
self.sort();
// Apply collision impulses
self.collide();
// Calculate new velocities and accelerations
self.integrate();
// Finally, advance the simulation clock
self.clock += 1;
    </@code>
    Because the program doesn't run in real time, simulating over one second
    may take more or less than a second. Calculating a larger number of shorter
    time steps will make the simulation more accurate, but will take longer to
    process. Fishbowl uses an number of optimizations to reduce processing time.
    By keeping the array of objects sorted from left to right, the number of collision
    checks is significantly reduced. The rendering system is decoupled from the simulation,
    and the two are pipelined together and run in parallel.
    <h2 class="distinct"> Rendering </h2>
    The method I used for drawing circles to a frame went through numerous iterations.
    Rendering performance is a major bottleneck, and so it was important to do so in
    parallel. After writing and benchmarking several software renderers, I landed on
    WebGPU. While quite bloated, WebGPU provides a fast, low level, and cross platform
    rendering API designed for async programs. This allows Fishbowl to easily integrate
    with both my server, which is entirely async, and the simulation, which is mostly 
    synchronous. While I would have liked to use a bespoke solution, GPU accelerated 
    rendering is far too quick to realistically consider any other option. 
    <h2 class="distinct"> Try It Out </h2>
    You can try out Fishbowl below, or download the CLI tool from my GitHub. 
    It works best on images that are roughly square and don't contain any text.
    Keep in mind the web version below will be slower and generate lower quality 
    results than the native application, as it is being run on my home server with
    limited resources.
