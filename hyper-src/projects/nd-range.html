    <h2 class="distinct"> Motivation </h2>
    The Rust standard library provides several 'Range' types which 
    represent integers inside a given bounds (i.e. 1 &#8804; n &#8804; 100).
    Ranges can be iterated over, and used for bounds testing of numbers.
    In designing video games, it is often necessary to express 2 or 3 
    dimensional quantities or bounds. Problems like iterating over
    voxels in a 3D world, or testing for an intersection between rectangles
    lend themselves to the idea of Ranges. 
<@code lang="rust">
// A 3D array representing a 128x128x128 voxel world
let world_data = [[[0; 128]; 128]; 128];
// The '0..128' here is a range from 0 to 127 inclusive
for x in 0..128 {
  for y in 0..128 {
    for z in 0..128 {
      let voxel = &world[x][y][z];
      // Do something with voxel
    }
  }
}
</@code>
  However, in these contexts the Range type is not particularly helpful. 
  I am forced to use three different ranges and a triple nested 'for' loop.
  The idea for nd-range is to expand the native Range type so that it 
  can be used over arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to iterate over
  X, Y, and Z coordinates in a single loop.
<@code lang="rust">
let world_data = [[[0; 128]; 128]; 128];
for [x, y, z] in nrange!(0..128, 0..128, 0..128) {
  let voxel = &world[x][y][z];
  // Do something with voxel
}
</@code>
  <h2 class="distinct"> Approach </h2>
  An nd-range is similar in concept to an axis-aligned bounding box, 
  or AABB. These are common abstractions used in game development, 
  and there are well established algorithms that test for overlap.
  Iterating over is slightly more complex, requiring some vector 
  algebra. If we interpret the range of values over each axis as a 
  vector, we can apply the cartesian product algorithm to find every
  position within the bounded space. Below is a diagram from Wikipedia
  (CC BY-SA 3.0).

  Because a range is contiguous by definition, generating a cartesian
  product is simple and performant. The iterator object has a space
  complexity of O(N), where n is the number of dimensions. Rust's const generics
  allow the entire struct to exist on the stack, which is a boon to performance. 
  <h2 class="distinct"> Performance </h2>
  My points of comparison are the itertools and cartesian crates, which provide
  comparable algorithms. Despite its popularity, I was shocked to discover how
  slow the itertools implementation of the cartesian product is. The cartesian-rs
  crate is lesser known, and uses a creative macro-based solution. I benchmarked
  all three approaches, as well as the nested for-loop base case, over a 100x100x100
  range.

  <h2 class="distinct"> Pros and Cons</h2>
  My implementation is competitive with, and possibly faster than
  its competitors for my use case. While nd-range only works for 
  ranges of contiguous integers, itertools and cartesian-rs work
  for any iterators. However, by restricting my use case I can
  extract more performance gains and integrate better with the Rust
  standard library.
